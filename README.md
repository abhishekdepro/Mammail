Every now and then we need to e-mail our friends, family and more. But the available suites are not only complicated but also time consuming. 

They are mainly targeted for business purposes like Microsoft Office Outlook, or Windows Live Mail. Those of you who use such mail clients definitely know that these programs have got a jerky performance as well as keeps you waiting for a minute or so just to synchronize(send/receive) mails from your mail accounts. 

What if I just need to send a mail in a couple of seconds to my friend or to a mailbox for a subscription closing in a minute. Well, here comes the time complexity. 

We need faster client-side apps for mailing. 

I have understood the need of such a software and I’m glad to present it before you.
